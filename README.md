# Isakov Artem
## Software Engineer / Data Engineer / Research Engineer / Research Assistant
I am a [graduate](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Master%20Diploma%20Supplement.pdf) of ETU "LETI" Electrotechnical University, my speciality is healthcare information systems. I'm trained in digital signal processing and analysis of biomedical information such as EEG, ECG, EMG as well as computed tomography image processing. My second specialisation is the development of applications and databases for medical research (m-Health). Currently studing at PhD programme ["Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"](https://abit.itmo.ru/phd) at ITMO University, focusing mainly on the development and implementation of such technologies in medicine.

I have also completed advanced training courses on additional professional programmes:
1. [Development of medical user interfaces](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Development%20of%20medical%20user%20interfaces.pdf)
2. [Methods of physiological data processing](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Methods%20of%20Physiological%20Data%20Processing.pdf)
3. [High-tech medical systems and complexes](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/High-tech%20medical%20systems%20and%20complexes.pdf)
4. [Professional management in the safety and ethics of application of artificial intelligence solutions in medicine and physiology](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Professional%20management%20in%20the%20safety%20and%20ethics%20of%20application%20of%20artificial%20intelligence%20solutions%20in%20medicine%20and%20physiology.pdf)
