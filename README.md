# Isakov Artem
## Software Engineer / Research Assistant / Data Engineer / Research Engineer
Hi, I am a [graduate](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/High-tech%20medical%20systems%20and%20complexes.pdf) of ETU "LETI" Electrotechnical University, my speciality is healthcare information systems. That means I'm trained in digital signal processing and analysis of biomedical information such as EEG, ECG, EMG as well as computed tomography image processing. My second specialisation is the development of applications and databases for medical research (m-Health). And my third field of study is basics of management and marketing (medical device service).

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree and am focusing on developing myself in iOS m-Health and Data Science development. In this direction I've completed postgraduate studies in the additional professional programme ["Development of medical user interfaces"](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Development%20of%20medical%20user%20interfaces.pdf) at "MIET" National Research University of Electronic Technology, postgraduate studies in the additional professional programme ["Methods of physiological data processing"](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/Methods%20of%20Physiological%20Data%20Processing.pdf) and ["High-tech medical systems and complexes"](https://github.com/artemisak/artemisak/blob/main/High-tech%20medical%20systems%20and%20complexes.pdf) at ETU "LETI" Electrotechnical University.
